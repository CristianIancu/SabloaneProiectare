Only second lab is written in java, the rest is cpp, i am currently a cpp software engineer and I wanted to make my cpp programing better!

Every lab is separated in folders
Every lab has a build and src folders, in build there is the compiled program and in src is the cource code of that program 
To run every lab just run it in comamnd with ./lab
You need to have cpp compiler installed to run it
